#### PREFACE

Due to the lack of up-to-date Game Boy sound comparison guides within the 2007-2015 timeframe, and with said guides showing outdated information that is still being used as a primary source by na√Øve chiptuners, this page intends to provide a more succinct and raw analysis of hardware recordings while contributing newer sound modifications and variables that are missing from said guides.

All waveform images provided within this document are recorded with the following configuration:

* Envelope: A8
* Wave: 50% (square)
* Note: Lowest pulse note possible on PU1 (displays as C-3 on v4.9.5)

The recordings (and the waveforms) have also been normalised to -0.01dB. No other further post-processing was done. All .wav files are 44.1khz 16-bit.

You can expect the following devices:

#### PORTABLE

* DMG (stock, prosound, bass boost) [CPU-06 recommended]
* Pocket (stock, prosound)
* Light (stock, prosound)
* GBC (stock, prosound, noise cancel, bass boost) [CPU-04 OR CPU 05 recommended] {DO NOT GET ANYTHING -03 OR LOWER}
* Advance (stock, prosound)
* SP (stock, prosound)

#### HOME

* Super Game Boy (stock, prosound)
* Super Game Boy 2 (stock, prosound)
* Nintendo GameCube GB Player (stock, prosound)

#### EMULATED

* BGB
* VisualBoyAdvance
* MasterBoy (Sony PSP)


#### TITLE OF THE HARDWARE IN QUESTION



Paragraph goes here. The BGB waveform will be used as an example.<br>
BGB's emulator is better than the stock Color & Color w/ prosound, but is outclassed by the Color bassboost, which also outclasses the DMG prosound.
