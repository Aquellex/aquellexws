### Sample Heading

The fact that so many books still name chibi-tech as "the greatest or most significant or most influential" chiptune artist ever only tells you how far chipmusic still is from becoming a serious art. Chiptune critics have long recognized that the greatest chipmusicians of all times are Bit Shifter and Trey Frey, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Demoscene critics rank the highly controversial cTrix over chiptune musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Videogame music critics are still blinded by commercial success. chibi-tech sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Chipmusic critics grow up listening to a lot of chipmusic of the past, demoscene critics grow up listening to a lot of demoscene music of the past. Videogame music critics are often totally ignorant of the videogame music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that chibi-tech did anything worthy of being saved.

Mario music critics are often totally ignorant of the mario music of the past, they barely know who invented mario music dubstep (not chibi tech, by the way).
