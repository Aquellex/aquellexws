            What started off as a fun idea in the middle of waiting for my next university tutorial,
            ended up becoming several hours of writer's block, heheheh! And since my good friend
            Kommisar and I were thinking of doing a collaboration of sorts, sending him the first
            minute of the project file was a fantastic move on my part for alleviating my writer's
            block, as he managed to come up with some sick trademark insaneous chiptune solos of his
            own. I took care of the main themes, drum programming & structuring, while he took care
            of his epic 3-minute solos. &#9829;
          </p>
          <p>We're doing a handful of these in the foreseeable future, by the way. Expect us!</p>

          <p>
            After finally recovering from severe emotional trauma in mid-June 2017, I went to work
            on my dream composition for ChipWIN 6. During my recovery period within the psychiatric
            hospital, I was listening to a lot of System Of A Down. Funnily enough, you could sing
            "She's Like Heroin" to some of the sections, and it'd fit in just fine. Of course, this
            composition demonstrates my fixation for writing concert-like études for the Game Boy as
            per usual. Fans of j-core will want to take note of this. &#9786;

            Originally started on October 2015 as a means to mimic the structuring from Renard's
            Banned Forever and one of the lead programming techniques used for YZYX's Gravity
            Distortion's main motif. Didn't finish until February 2017 in time for Square Sounds
            Melbourne 2017 pre-party. That was an awesome night. Glad I was able to finally put this
            étude to rest.

            You might be interested where the alternate title "Hatred of Renard" comes from. That
            comes from an object named "Hatred of Goku", which is used for unlocking certain
            characters in Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2.

          <p>
            I was invited to take part of a local radio show that hosts all kinds of eccentric music
            (sound art, IDM, breakcore, ambient, drone, the whole lot etc.). Due to university and
            HalloWIN commitments, I almost wasn't able to contribute anything at all, but then I set
            aside a full day to compose something really cool just relying on lydian chords and
            quartal harmonies, and this was the result. Still one of my personal favourites to this
            day. &#9786;

            I had a lot of fun composing this dream track for ChipWIN 5. Draws a lot of inspiration
            from YZYX's -flux series and music you'd expect from rhythm game simulations (BMS).
            Contains a reference to The Quick Brown Fox's Wanderlust as a jab towards a trolling
            tactic on Tumblr where 2 people thought it was funny to make parody names of a
            LapFox-inspired netlabel (one I was a part of, as well). I had my fun as well. &#9786;

            The composition that kickstarted my chipbreaking career. Also serves as an étude + ode
            to YZYX's ._Pulse. So many great memories spending time composing this beast. Also, if
            you've played the 2nd or 3rd Ratchet &amp; Clank PS2 games, you'll recognise a familiar
            sound effect somewhere...&#9829;
