        <h4>Ballistic Bunny (feat. Kommisar)</h4> &#8729; 'Game Boy' Metal + Double Time Drum & Bass

        <p>What started off as a fun idea in the middle of waiting for my next university tutorial, ended up becoming several hours of writer's block, heheheh! And since my good friend Kommisar and I were thinking of doing a collaboration of sorts, sending him the first minute of the project file was a fantastic move on my part for alleviating my writer's block, as he managed to come up with some sick trademark insaneous chiptune solos of his own. I took care of the main themes, drum programming & structuring, while he took care of his epic 3-minute solos. &#9829;</p>
        <p>We're doing a handful of these in the foreseeable future, by the way. Expect us!</p>
