title: 'The Spirit Engine DX announcement'
---

After a full year of development in 2024 and getting involved with the original developers Mark Pay & Josh Whelchel, we are announcing The Spirit Engine DX! It's surreal to be collaborating with my childhood role models 2 decades later!

That meansâ€¦go wishlist the game on Steam! Right now!
