It's been a while since I updated the pages properly - the organisation has been very chaotic as of late, but I've gotten around to updating a couple of pages around here (about, goodies, the Game Boy comparison page etc.). I'm also proud to announce that I have an LP that will be ready to launch by Februrary of 1st, 2020! Here's the tentative tracklist so far:

```
1. Excitement
2. Promenade
3. Decipher.#003
4. Decipher.#004
5. Ballistic Bunny (feat. Kommisar)
6. Shimmering Glimmer

8. Candy Explosion REV 1.2
9. Megaflux
10. Hyperflux
11. Anthropomorphosis
12. Exit Clause
