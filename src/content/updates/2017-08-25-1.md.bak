title: 'Added spoiler tags to YouTube Videos in the music section'
---

I realised how much memory is consumed when trying to load too many embedded videos in one
page. Hopefully, adding a spoiler tag can alleviate memory problems. If problems still
persist, do not hestitate to get in touch with me. You may also want to try refreshing the
cache (Ctrl+F5) first, however. Cheers!
