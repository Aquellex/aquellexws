title: 'Anthropomorphosis released'
---

After commencing the album on the 5th of February, 2016, my first album, Anthropomorphosis, has finally concluded on the 11th of September, 2023, and is now released at the time of this post.

I apologise for taking so long to finish this album--the level of ambition turned out to be a nightmare! Lots and lots of decision paralysis, and an eccentric ego regarding wanting to max out my project files on LSDj.

In other news, I have become a [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-09-17-new-featured-artist-aquellex) for osu!. They also commissioned me to compose a track for 2023's 4-key World Cup. You can find it as track #8 in the album!
